# ViewTrans

View-Tokenized Transformer for Sinogram Restoration in Sparse-View CT

Overview:
ViewTrans is a novel deep learning framework for restoring full-view sinograms from sparse-view inputs in computed tomography (CT). Unlike conventional vision Transformers that tokenize 2D images by patches, ViewTrans introduces a view-tokenized strategy, treating each fan-beam projected vector as a token â€” fully consistent with the physics of CT scanning. It can either be paired with a traditional FBP layer for end-to-end sparse-view CT reconstruction, or serve as a versatile component within dual-domain reconstruction pipelines, operating specifically in the sinogram domain.

The code was written in Python 3.8 and Pytorch 1.11.0.You can train the model from scratch by running train.py, or directly evaluate the reconstruction performance on a sample image using test.py.
